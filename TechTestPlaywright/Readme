Solution
 
1. Created a maven project
2. Add package with required class
3. Class includes two methods:
- Method for API test to register a new user
- Method for Login and category creation
3. Use TestNG annotations to run tests
4. Use postman to send request and validate results and implement it in code 

Note: Additional comments in code

Prerequisites

Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Chromium
Required Software: 
- You need to have installed Java(JDK) and Maven with the respective environemnt variables added
- TestNG installed
- Dependencies in POM.xml file for: Playwright, TestNG, Playwright, jackson databind

Run tests

1. Create a new workspace path
2. Add project folder in the workspace path
3. Open Eclipse >> Select required workspace
4. Go to TechTestPlaywright\src\test\java\exercise2 package and open class QubikaSportsClub(Double Click)
5. Run Test, we have to options for that:
- Run tests individualy by clicking on "Run" above each Test
- Run test together by clicking on "Run All" above class

Approach

For this implementation we are using one class hoever we could use Page Object model pattern if we want to improve the order and functionality.

We could stablish:
Base Page: Isolate the test framework from any change that Selenium API suffers
Object Pages: Locators and  methods of a page 
Test Clases(TestNG or JUnit): These will call the methods in the object pages
